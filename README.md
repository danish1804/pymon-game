# 🐍 Pymon Game – A Python-Based Creature Battle Adventure

**Pymon** is a terminal-based, turn-based creature capture and battle game written in Python. Inspired by Pokémon, the game allows players to explore locations, encounter wild creatures (Pymons), collect items, and engage in strategic battles — all through a modular, object-oriented design.

This project was developed as part of an academic assignment to demonstrate proficiency in OOP, file handling, modular design, and menu-driven CLI interfaces.
